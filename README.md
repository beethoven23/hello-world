LegalTech / Practicing Law like a Coder

I am interesting in any sort of overlap between technology and law. I believe drafting contracts is not any different to coding. Similar parlells or other type of legal work. I am interested in other people's views, espcially lawyers with some coding background like myself.

I used to develop softwsare long ago in the 80's/early 90's, so my level of knowledge of modern programming langauges is very limited. Would like to learn more if I ever find the time for it.
